# AWEB-ATT-CK-Weakness-Embedding-Bridge
AWEB (ATT&amp;CK Weakness Embedding Bridge) is a model designed to connect ATT&amp;CK techniques with Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) by leveraging advanced embeddings from LLMs and graph-based networks. This repository provides a simple interface to retrieve ATT&amp;CK and CWE descriptions relevant to a given query using the AWEB model.
